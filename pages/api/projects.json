We focused on redesigning a calorie counting app to align with the healthcare theme of our course, aiming to identify and implement the ideal balance that enhances user experience.</p><br></br> <u><strong style='color: #6A5ACD;'>Project Statement:</strong></u>  <ul style='padding-left: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;'>  <li><strong>Problem:</strong> High user dropout rates in diet tracking apps due to tediousness (84%) and lack of ease of use (24%) (Laing et al., 2015)</li>   <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Common complaints include apps being overly fanciful or cluttered with too much information</li>  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Redesign fitness apps to encourage continuous use by simplifying complexity</li>    <li><strong>Design Goal:</strong> Strike a balance between visceral appeal and functional complexity to avoid extremes that deter users</li>  </ul><br> <p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>We employed an iterative approach in developing the User Interface (UI) prototypes to address a unique problem. Our strategy involved designing the app in three distinct styles to balance visual appeal and functionality.</p><br><br>  <u><strong style='color: #FFD700;'>Main Strategy:</strong></u><p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>We developed three versions of the app, each focusing on a different design philosophy:  <ul style='padding-left: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;'>     <li><strong>Highly Visceral:</strong> Emphasizes aesthetics and immediate emotional response</li>    <li><strong>Highly Behavioral:</strong> Focuses on functionality and usability</li>   <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Combines both visceral and behavioral design elements</li>  </ul><br> <p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>To ensure consistency across these versions, each design includes three core features, ensuring no loss of content.</p><br><br>   <u><strong style='color: #32CD32;'>Feature 1: Calorie Counter</strong></u> <p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>The Calorie Counter is designed to display critical information in a clear and user-friendly manner:    <ul style='padding-left: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;'>     <li><strong>Nett Calories for the Day:</strong> Provides a quick summary of daily caloric intake</li>    <li><strong>Calories Consumed:</strong> Tracks the total calories consumed throughout the day</li>    <li><strong>Calories Burnt:</strong> Shows the calories burned through physical activities</li>    <li><strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Includes detailed breakdowns with progress bars<br>   <ul style='padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px;'>    <li>Carbohydrates</li>  <li>Fats</li>  <li>Protein</li>  </ul>   </li> </ul></p><br></br>   <u><strong style='color: #FF6347;'>Feature 2: Food & Exercise Diary</strong></u><p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>Displays essential details and functionalities for: <ul style='padding-left: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;'>   <li><strong>Daily Log:</strong> Meals and exercises performed throughout the day</li>   <li><strong>Meal/Exercise Entry:</strong> Interface to add and select meals or exercises (up to 12 meals displayed)</li>  <li><strong>Serving Size:</strong> Select number of servings (If Food)</li>   <li><strong>Workout Details:</strong> Select sets, repetitions, weight (If Exercise)</li>  <li><strong>Food Information:</strong>  <ul style='padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px;'>   <li>Description</li>       <li>Calories</li>    <li>Macro & micro nutrients</li>    </ul>  </li> </ul></p><br></br>  <u><strong style='color: #6A5ACD;'>Feature 3: Achievements</strong></u>  <p style='color: #FFFFFF;'>Displays all 6 attainable badges with: <ul style='padding-left: 20px; color: #FFFFFF;'>  <li>Badge Icon</li>  <li>Badge Name</li>  <li>Badge Description</li> <li>Badge Progress</li>  <li>Percentage</li>   <li>Progress Bar</li> </ul></p><br>  <p style='color: #FFFFFF;'><strong>Note:</strong> As I was responsible for the visceral design, only the visceral design aspects are presented here.
