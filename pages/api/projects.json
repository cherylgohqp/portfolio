    "details": "During my tenure at Lendlease, I thrived in an <u>agile</u> environment with <u>fortnightly sprints</u>, where I utilized <u>ReactJS frameworks</u> to design and develop dynamic components and features. <br></br> I played a key role in the overall website revamping, <u>developing</u> new interactive components and <u>integrating</u> new functionalities with <u>back-end APIs</u>, ensuring seamless and rapid deployment within our project timelines. <br></br> My efforts in developing Storybook components significantly <u>streamlined</u> our development processes and <u>enhanced overall efficiency</u>. Additionally, I implemented <u>Datadog integration</u> within our ReactJS application, providing comprehensive front-end monitoring and real-time user analytics. This optimization improved performance and ensured a seamless user experience.<br></br> Colleagues have praised my dedication to crafting <u>clean, modular, and well-documented</u> code, that delivers exceptional user experiences. My commitment to high-quality results and continuous learning from senior engineers has been pivotal in navigating the challenges of a dynamic development environment. <br></br> Here's a video featuring P4D:",
