    "description": "As part of a team of five, we embarked on a two-month project to redesign a calorie counting app. Our objective was to apply a UI concept learned in class to enhance the app's usability and overall user experience.",
    "details": "We chose to revamp the existing calorie counting app, focusing on improving its visual appeal and functionality through innovative design strategies. <br></br> <u><strong>Project Overview:</strong></u><br></br> This project centered on exploring the interplay between <strong>Visceral</strong> and <strong>Behavioral </strong> design to optimize user satisfaction in a health-related app. Our goal was to balance these design aspects to enhance the overall user experience and improve app ratings. We focused on redesigning a calorie counting app to align with the healthcare theme of our course, aiming to identify and implement the ideal balance that enhances user experience <br></br> <u><strong>Project Statement:</strong></u> <br></br> <li><strong>Problem:</strong> High user dropout rates in diet tracking apps due to tediousness (84%) and lack of ease of use (24%) (Laing et al., 2015)</li> <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Common complaints include apps being overly fanciful or cluttered with too much information</li> <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Redesign fitness apps to encourage continuous use by simplifying complexity</li><li><strong>Design Goal:</strong> Strike a balance between visceral appeal and functional complexity to avoid extremes that deter users</li> <br></br> We employed an iterative approach in developing the User Interface (UI) prototypes to address a unique problem. Our strategy involved designing the app in three distinct styles to balance visual appeal and functionality.<br></br><u><strong>Main Strategy:</strong></u><br></br> We developed three versions of the app, each focusing on a different design philosophy: <li><strong>Highly Visceral:</strong> Emphasizes aesthetics and immediate emotional response</li> <li><strong>Highly Behavioral:</strong> Focuses on functionality and usability</li> <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Combines both visceral and behavioral design elements</li><br></br> To ensure consistency across these versions, each design includes three core features, ensuring no loss of content.<br></br> <u><strong>Feature 1: Calorie Counter</strong></u><br></br> The Calorie Counter is designed to display critical information in a clear and user-friendly manner. <li><strong>Nett Calories for the day:</strong> Provides a quick summary of daily caloric intake</li> <li><strong>Calories Consumed:</strong> Tracks the total calories consumed throughout the day</li> <li><strong>Calories Burnt:</strong> Shows the calories burned through physical activitiies <li><strong>Macronutrients:</strong> Includes detailed breakdowns with progress bars<br></br> <u><strong>Feature 2: Food & Exercise Diary:</strong></u><br></br> Displays essential details and functionalities for:</li> <ul style='padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 10px;'> <li><strong>Daily Log:</strong> Meals and exercises performed throughout the day</li> <li><strong>Meal/Exercise Entry:</strong> Interface to add and select meals or exercises (up to 12 meals displayed)</li> <li><strong>Serving Size:</strong> Select number of servings (If Food) </li> <li><strong>Workout details:</strong> Select sets, repetitions, weight (If Exercise) </li> <li><strong>Food Information:</strong> <ul style='padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 5px;'> <li>Description</li> <li>Calories</li> <li>Macro & micro nutrients </li></ul> </li> </ul><br></br> <strong><u>Feature 3 - Achievements</u></strong> <br></br>Displays all 6 attainable badges with:<ul style='padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 10px;'> <li>Badge Icon</li> <li>Badge Name</li> <li>Badge Description</li> <li>Badge Progress</li> <li>Percentage</li> <li>Progress Bar</li></ul><br></br><strong>Note:</strong> As I was responsible for the visceral design, only the visceral design aspects are presented here.
